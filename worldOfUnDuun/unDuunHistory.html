          First came the Orcs, Made to tame the world. <br>
          Plants and trees bloomed across the land and so too were born the Fae and their Kin the Elven people.<br>
          Mountains rose to the sky, valleys were split and born were the Dragonkin.<br>
          The seas rose and washed rivers and lakes across the land with these waters came the Dainfolk.<br>
          The fire of the world itself spit from the mountains and so were born the Plane-touched.<br>
          The many people thrived and magic rose into the world and so came the half-folk.<br>
          All was made and all was good until a darkness bled into the world.<br>
          Anger and jealousy grew until the world divided into nations.<br>
          Darkness took hold and the sky was lit afire, the lands were split, and empires fell.<br>
          The world has rebuilt but the darkness remains and is rising again.<br>
